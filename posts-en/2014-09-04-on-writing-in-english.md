I've been thinking about this for some time, and I came to the conclusion that
it's a good idea I start writing in English too.

There's a lack of good programming sites in Portuguese, so it's relatively easy
to try to fill this vacuum.  But it's also this, a vacuum, so I can't stop
feeling that I'm writing for nobody.  This lack of content is so remarkable that
it has become second nature to me and my friends: whenever we need/want to
search for something, we don't even bother trying to search for it in
Portuguese.

This is true for many programming subjects.  Good luck trying to find texts in
Portuguese on cache-oblivious algorithms, dependent types, branch misprediction,
generalized algebraic data type and the like.  Even when something was developed
by Brazilians (like the [Lua][L] language), most of its developement happens in
English, simply because [it's the lingua franca of software development][LF].

At last, this is also a way for me to practice my English skills.  I read and
listen to English a lot, but I don't write or talk so much.  Notice, however,
that I won't translate every article.  Some will be English only and some will
be Portuguese only.  I'll pick a language based on the intended audience of the
article, but if you feel that you may be missing something, send me a heads up
and I'll try to translate it as soon as possible.
