## About me

I'm André Ramaciotti da Silva, born and raised in Sao Paulo, where I acquired a
certain taste in programming, music and foreign languages.  Currently, I live in
Blumenau -- southern Brazil -- and study Computer Science.

I have some years of professional experience in QA and software development --
mostly with C++, C# and Java --, but what I really like the most is the more
theoretical side of Computer Science.

In this blog, you'll find my ramblings on different topics as I try to escape
from the tiresome CRUD that takes up most of professional software development.

### Disclaimer

The usual applies: these texts are only my personal opinion and don't reflect
the opinions of my current or former employers, yadda yadda yadda.

Also, I avoid getting into polemic subjects, but if you feel offended by
something I wrote, just let me know.

## About software I use

I try to be pragmatic in my choices, but I have a strong preference for FOSS.
My favorite OS is [Arch Linux][AR] and I usually develop using [GNU Emacs][E]
and [zsh][Z] (with [oh-my-zsh][OMZ]).

You can check out my current projects on my [GitHub account][GH].
